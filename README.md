# Monaco-Editor Svelte3 Kit Snowpack3 Example

This repository is based on the highly unstable and experimental `@sveltejs/kit@1.0.0-next.31`.

The snowpack config had to be replaced completely, as the presets of the svelte config do not allow much customization.

Have a look at the files or at the second commit to understand, which changes are necessary to a codebase.

Run `npm install` to initialize and `npm run dev` to start the development environment.

Kudos to wires and his repository [github.com/wires/debugging-snowpack-svelte-monaco](https://github.com/wires/debugging-snowpack-svelte-monaco), without which I would not have been able to understand the setup of svelte, snowpack and monaco-editor.

Cheers and happy coding!
